Various Pieces of the Puzzle
----------------------------

We need a way to do writes that extend beyond a single object modfication.
Should we have an optimization for modifying single objects?
How should adding and removing nodes work w/ Transactions.

Algorithm Transaction:
  1. allocate transaction_id
  2. lock all objects known involved in transaction
  3. attempt transaction:
    3a. if successful
      3a1. write back all objects along with transaction id
      3a2. add to set of recently succeeded transactions
    3b. if failed:
      3b1. unlock all current objects
      3b2. return failure
    3c. if needs more objects:
      3c1. unlock all current objects
      3c2. add needed objects to set of objects involved in transaction
      3c3. goto 2
  
Algorithm Add Node:
  1. determine which buckets need replication
  2. replicate buckets while listening to new events for those buckets

Algorithm Delete Node:
